## üß† What is Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)?

**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** ‚Äî now known as **Microsoft Entra ID** ‚Äî is a cloud-based **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service by Microsoft.  
It helps secure access to applications and resources by providing features like authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and conditional access.

Key features:

- Authentication & Authorization
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- App Registrations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integration with Microsoft 365 and third-party apps

## üîë What is Identity and Identity Provider?

### Identity:

An **identity** represents who you are in a digital system ‚Äî like your email, username, or employee ID.  
**Example:** When you log into Gmail using your email address, that email acts as your identity.

### Identity Provider (IdP):

An **Identity Provider** is a service that verifies and manages identities and provides authentication services to other apps.  
**Example:** When you click "Login with Google" or "Login with Microsoft", Google or Microsoft acts as the **Identity Provider**.

In this project, **Azure Entra ID** is the **Identity Provider** for our React app.
